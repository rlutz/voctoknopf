Voctoknopf front panel
----------------------

Front panel for the TEKO 363 enclosure.

The layout of the front panel is defined in `p3-panel.py` and
`p2-panel.py` for each of the two variants (3-camera and 2-camera),
respectively.  From each of these scripts, a set of `*.data` files is
generated which encode the necessary 2D movements of the mill.

These `*.data` files are included in the repository for your
convenience.  In order to re-build them, you need Python 2.7,
Inkscape, and the stroke font “Machine Tool Gothic” (`machtgth.ttf`)
which you can find here:

The data files, in turn, are used to generate the output files:
* `*.gcode` for milling
* `*.eps` for visually inspecting the movement patterns of the mill
* `*.pdf` and `*.png` for previewing of the expected result

These can easily be generated by running `make` (requires Python 2.7).

**Please note:** The GCode files are generated using parameters that
worked for me, at one specific time, with one particular mill.  You
will most certainly have to change the parameters according to your
physical setup.
